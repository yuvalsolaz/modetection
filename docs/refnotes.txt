replace learning with training

2. Methodology: Utilizing the those features  - remove the the 
Figure 1. In the data acquisition phase, the data required for the learning - for training 

2.1. Strategy : for data collection required in the
learning process. - in the training process

2.1. Strategy
In this research we use a single user with a single phone for data collection required in the
learning process- this is an operational constrainte , data from more users and more devices should improve the classification accuracy 

Features are extracted based solely on
the magnitudes of the specific force and angular velocity vectors - we did not use the vectors direction becouse it's sesativity to the device orientation in the person hand / pocket   

whats the meaning of zero crossing for vector norm ?
multi class svm ( svm is binary )

Table 2. Accuracy Results - need to explain the accuracy term : precision , recall , recall precision  

feature importance - need a feature translation amgforce === amplitude gforce

add what else could be done to improve accuracy : xgboost CNN RNN , use additional sensors
